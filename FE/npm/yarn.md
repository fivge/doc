##### `~`用户根目录下配置

```bash
yarn config set yarn-offline-mirror ./npm-packages-offline-cache
yarn config set yarn-offline-mirror-pruning true
```

_`./npm-packages-offline-cache` is an example location relative to home folder where all the source`.tar.gz` files will be downloaded to from the registry._

`.yarnrc`

```vbscript
# THIS IS AN AUTOGENERATED FILE. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.

##### 要求

https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2016/11/24/lockfiles-for-all/

**所有 `yarn.lock` 文件应该被提交到版本控制系统（例如 git 或者 mercurial）**。 这允许 Yarn 跨所有机器安装相同的依赖树，无论它是你同事的笔记本还是 CI 服务器。
